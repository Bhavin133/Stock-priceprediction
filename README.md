# Stock Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning algorithms. It uses historical stock data to forecast future prices, employing models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and more. The project is implemented using Python and libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (if using deep learning models)
- yfinance (for stock data)

You can install the required libraries with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
